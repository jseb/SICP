#### Exercise 1.11
A function $f$ is defined by the rule that $f(n)=n$ if $n<3$ and $f(n)=f(n-1)+2f(n-2)+3f(n-3)$ if $n\geq{3}$. Write a procedure that computes $f$ by means of a recursive process. Write a procedure that computes $f$ by means of an iterative process.

####Answer
So the definition of $f$ is:

$$
\[ f(n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
n & \mbox{if $n<3$}\\
f(n-1)+2f(n-2)+3f(n-3)\end{array} \right. \]
$$

This translates to the following procedure which computes $f$ by using a recursive process:

	(define (f n)
        (if (< n 3) n)
            (+ (f (- n 1))
                (* 2 (f (- n 2)))
                (* 3 (f (- n 3)))))

To use an iterative process we can use a triplet of integers $a$ $b$ and $c$, initialized as $f(2)=2$, $f(1)=1$ and $f(0)=0$, and repeatedly apply the transformations

$$a\leftarrow{a+2*b+3*c}$$
$$b\leftarrow{a}$$
$$c\leftarrow{b}$$

This translates to the following procedure which uses an iterative process:

	(define (f n)
        (f-iter 2 1 0 n))

	(define (f-iter a b c count)
        (if (= count 0)
            c
            (f-iter (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c)) a b (- count 1))))
